This article tells you what you can do with Obix and why Obix helps to write more reliable code.</p></div></div></div><hr></div><p>"Why still another programming language?" you might ask. Before answering this justified question, let us first briefly describe the main characteristics of Obix.</p><p>Obix is:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a high-level, object-oriented, statically-typed, compiled, portable programming language</p></li><li><p>open-source, licensed under the AGPL version 3</p></li><li><p>currently in beta version</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p><p>The compiler generates Java binary code (.class files). Hence, applications written in Obix can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, such as Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.</p><p>You can download a binary distribution for Linux or Windows (free of charge) from www.rps-obix.com. A tutorial, reference manual, API browser, and links to a bug tracker and the Git source code repository are also available on the website.</p><p>There is currently no support for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse. All tools for managing projects and compiling, running and testing code are executed from the command line.</p><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="io_more_reliable_code"></a>More reliable code ...</h2></div></div></div><p>Do you like bugs in programs? Nobody likes them! They frustrate programmers, users, managers, bosses and other people. The software industry reveals that finding and repairing bugs has cost huge amounts of time and money. Projects have failed because of 'too many bugs' and numerous bugs have created high damages. For concrete examples, just search for something like 'expensive software bug' on the net.</p><p>For that reason Obix has been designed from the outset on with a very specific main goal in mind, namely to help writing more reliable code. In practice this means that:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>once your code passes compilation it contains less bugs</p></li><li><p>remaining bugs are more quickly detected at runtime</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p><p>As a result you can expect to reduce development time and costs.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>'more reliable code'</em></span> goal is achieved through the following very important <span class="emphasis"><em>Fail fast!</em></span> rule which is consistently embedded in the language and the libraries:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Every coding error should be detected as early as possible,<br>
preferably at compile-time, or else as early as possible at run-time.</em></span></p><p>This rule is important and effective because studies done by prominent companies such as IBM and NASA show that costs generated through software bugs increase exponentially when the bugs are detected late in the software development process. The following figure demonstrates this schematically.</p><div class="figure"><a name="io_costs_of_bugs"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. Costs of program errors (bugs) in software developments</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="costs_time_small.jpg" alt="Costs of program errors (bugs) in software developments"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>To achieve the goal of early error-detection Obix incorporates a <span class="emphasis"><em>unique combination of over 20 proven and innovative 'Fail fast!' concepts</em></span>. Some of the most important built-in error-preventing concepts are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Contract programming (Design by Contract)</li><li>Feature redefinition in child types</li><li>Unit testing</li><li>Generic types without type erasure at runtime</li><li>Objects are immutable by default</li><li>Void (null) values are not allowed by default</li></ul></div><p>Because all <span class="emphasis"><em>Fail fast!</em></span> concepts are part of the language they work and evolve seamlessly together. They are easy to use and there are no version conflicts or dependencies on third-party extensions.</p><p>To illustrate one of Obix's unique features for more reliable code, look at the following example source-code:</p><pre class="programlisting">int server_port = 8080
int age_of_my_elephant = server_port</pre><p>Can you see the error? Of course, you can.</p><p>Can your compiler see the error? No, it can't. Although <code class="code">server_port</code> and <code class="code">age_of_my_elephant</code> are obviously two semantically different values, the compiler can't see an incompatibility, because both values are of type <code class="code">integer</code>. Moreover, no run-time error will be generated, despite the fact that elephants can't be older than about 100 years.</p><p>You might say: "No programmer would ever write silly code like this!" This is true (for most programmers !!!). However, look at this code:</p><pre class="programlisting">int age_of_elephant = utilities.get_initial_value</pre><p>Now you can't tell if the assignment is ok by just looking at the source code. You would have to manually verify that <code class="code">utilities.get_initial_value</code> actually returns an <code class="code">age_of_elephant</code> value which can't be negative and can't exceed 100. It would be helpful if the compiler could check all this for you automatically, wouldn't it?</p><p>Without digging too deep in how it works, here is the solution in Obix. You would define a specific type <code class="code">age_of_elephant</code> and declare a positive maximum value of 100. The source code for this type looks as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">type age_of_elephant
	
   inherit simple_positive32
      attribute value and_check: i_value &lt;= 100~ end
   end
	
end</pre><p>Then, you would declare a variable and assign it a value as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">var age_of_elephant age_of_my_elephant = ...</pre><p>Now the Obix compiler ensures that the right side of the assignment actually returns an <code class="code">age_of_elephant</code> value (and not a <code class="code">server_port</code> value). And it is impossible to assign an invalid value such as -5 or 8080.</p><p>Many applications contain hundreds or thousands of integer variables with semantically different (and therefore incompatible) values. Compile-time and run-time checks like the above one are therefore very important and effective, because any incompatibilities and illegal values are immediately and automatically reported. The same observation can be made for other data types such as strings. For example, in Obix you would define different types with specific validation rules for <code class="code">customer_name</code>, <code class="code">email_adress</code> and <code class="code">ISBN_number</code>.</p><p>All error-detection concepts are fully described in Obix's documentation and numerous examples show why they increase software reliability. To get an overview of the different techniques you can read part II of the Obix tutorial. This part guides you step by step in the development of an example application that creates a random picture based on data provided by people. Here is an example of such a picture, saved in a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file:</p><div class="figure"><a name="io_random_arcs"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2. Obix programming language 'random arcs' tutorial example</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="200"><tr><td><img src="arcs_example_3a.jpg" width="200" alt="Obix programming language 'random arcs' tutorial example"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="io_in_less_time"></a>... in less time</h2></div></div></div><p>Besides the number 1 goal (increased software reliability), Obix's web site also explains and gives examples of the two other main goals which are also pursued since decades in the software industry:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>increase developer productivity</p></li><li><p>simplify the software development process</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p><p>One example is the tight integration and support of Java software in Obix applications. You can use any existing Java software (.class or .jar files) in an Obix project and data can be easily exchanged between Java and Obix. The following Obix source code snippet shows an example of a variable declared and initialized in Obix, and then used in Java code:</p><pre class="programlisting">var string name = "Lisa Simpson" // Obix code
java
   System.out.println ( "Hello from Obix and Java, " + v_name.java_value() ); // Java code
end java</pre><p>Executing this code will display:</p><pre class="screen">Hello from Obix and Java, Lisa Simpson</pre><p>Part I of Obix's tutorial explains Obix's integrated support for easily creating different kinds of applications, ranging from executing a single instruction up to creating a complex web application using Java's servlet and JSP technology. For example, you can create a simple arithmetic calculator 'application' by using Obix's script file facility as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>After installing Obix, create file <code class="code">tests/calculator.osc</code> in Obix's root directory and insert the following code:
				</p><pre class="programlisting">const string input = system.console.ask_string ( "Please enter an arithmetic expression: " )

const any_type output = source_code_executer.evaluate_expression.result ( expression = input )

if output #r void then
   system.console.write ( "Result: " &amp; output.to_string )
end if</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>Now execute the calculator by entering the following command in Obix's root directory:
				</p><pre class="programlisting">on Windows, type
obix tests\calculator.osc

on Linux, type
./obix.sh tests/calculator.osc</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>When prompted, type any arithmetic expression such as:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">( 1 + 2 ) * 3</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>After pressing &lt;Enter&gt; the result will be displayed:
			</p><pre class="screen">Result: 9</pre><p>
			</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="io_help_needed"></a>Help needed!</h2></div></div></div><p>Obix started as a one-man project. The author is currently looking for people interested to collaborate, in order to improve Obix, create and maintain an open-source community and finally make Obix a mainstream programming language that helps to write reliable production code in less time. You are very welcome to participate.
