<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>What is a <font color="#FF6600">pragmatic</font> ?</i></b></font></p>
<p>The word &#145;pragmatic&#146; is derived from the Latin word &#145;pragmaticus&#146;, 
  which means &#145;skilled in business&#146;, and which itself is derived from 
  the Greek &#145;to do&#146;.</p>
<p>We can think of pragmatics as confirmed practical rules that should be applied 
  whenever possible.</p>
<p><br>
  <font size="+1"><b><i>Why pragmatics ?</i></b></font></p>
<p>Striving for perfection is a natural and human desire. We feel that something 
  is perfect if there are no faults, no inconveniences, no limitations. Everything 
  is exactly as we wish it to be. When speaking about products (goods), 3 properties 
  are generally considered to determine the degree of perfection:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>quality</b></li>
  <li><b>functionality</b></li>
  <li><b>price</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A perfect product would be of highest quality, without any missing functionality 
  and free of charge. It is not easy to find examples of real perfection. The 
  best one coming to my mind is: oxygen. Oxygen is perfectly suited for our bodies 
  (when not polluted by humans), available nearly everywhere (worldwide, up to 
  altitudes of about 4000 meters), unlimited in quantity and time as well as free 
  of charge for everyone. Nobody ever complained about oxygen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most products constructed by imperfect humans are inherently 
  imperfect, especially in the world of complex technologies like software. In 
  these cases we consider a fourth property:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>support</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply said, the amount of needed support is inversely proportional to the 
  degree of perfection. If a product is perfect then we don't need any support, 
  as in the case of oxygen. Analogously a lot of support is always a sign for 
  imperfection. Translated to the world of software we deduce (as we all know 
  already) that most software is far away from perfection.</p>
<p>Pragmatics can be particularly helpful for achieving the highest possible degree 
  of perfection. A pragmatic is a rule that has been established as a result of 
  past experiences and whose truth has been confirmed in practice. Pragmatics 
  should be general, easy to understand, and applicable by everyone. At every 
  step the developer should ask himself:</p>
<p align="center"> <i><b>Do I respect all pragmatics? </b></i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, applying pragmatics isn't always easy. Most of the time a lot 
  of discipline and effort is necessary. Limits may exist due to the chosen technology 
  and available resources. Sometimes it is even impossible to apply a given pragmatic 
  to every situation (examples will follow). As a consequence compromises must 
  be made occasionally in order to balance human effort, needed resources and 
  usefulness. But anyway, the existence of pragmatics and their consistent appliance 
  whenever possible can considerably increase a product's success.</p>
<p>The following chapters present pragmatics that had been defined before starting 
  the development of Obix. Thus they represent some fundamental ideas and principles 
  which are always applied as far as possible. They are classified by quality, 
  functionality, price and support.</p>
