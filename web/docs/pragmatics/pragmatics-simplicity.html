<p class="pragmatic">Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not 
  simpler!<br>
  (Albert Einstein)</p>
<p>This famous and wonderful sentence of one of the greatest geniuses (Albert 
  Einstein has been elected <dfn>Person of the last century</dfn> by <dfn>Time 
  Magazine</dfn>) doesn't need any further explanation. We all want products which 
  are easy to use.</p>
<p>If something isn't easy to use, people simply avoid using it. Some examples 
  can be found in the world of software development. Concepts which are essential 
  for high quality, such as <dfn>design by contract</dfn> and <dfn>automatic testing</dfn>, 
  are often ignored by programmers, mainly because they are not built-in and easy-to-use 
  features of the language. Hence, the decisive criterion is not if something 
  is <em>possible</em> to be done in a language, but <em>how easy</em> it is to 
  do it. The lack of simplicity was one of the main motivations for developing 
  Obix. The examples found throughout the <a href="../manuals/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> 
  will hopefully convince the readers that Obix really simplifies programming, 
  without sacrificing powerfulness.</p>
