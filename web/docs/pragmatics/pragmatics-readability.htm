<p class="pragmatic">Readability is more important than number of keystrokes!</p>
<p>Consider the following statement written in a programming language like Java 
  or C:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre>

<code>Utilities.message ( &quot;Information&quot;, &quot;Readability is important!&quot;, RED, true, false ) ;<br></code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Visibly, this statement is used to display a message to the user. We suppose 
  that <code>Utilities</code> is a class, because it is a convention that class 
  names start with an uppercase letter, and we believe that the programmer knows 
  and applies this convention. We suppose that the message displayed is &quot;<code>Readability 
  is important!</code>&quot;. Parameter <code>RED</code> must be<code></code>, 
  also by convention, a constant, and we guess that it is used to define some 
  color, but we don't know if it is the color of the text, or the text's background, 
  or whatever. And we have no idea about what the last two parameters are used 
  for. There is a lot of uncertainty when reading the above statement. If we want 
  to know more we have to look at the definition of the function (if we know where 
  to find it and have access to it) or we must read the technical documentation 
  (if it exists and is up to date).<br>
</p>
<p>Obix uses a different syntax to avoid such error-prone uncertainties. The above 
  statement would be written like this:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre>

<code>se_utilities.co_message ( &amp;
   window_title  = &quot;Information&quot; &amp;
   message       = &quot;Readability is important!&quot; &amp;
   text_color    = en_red &amp;
   cancel_button = yes &amp;
   log_message   = no )<br></code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Sure, the programmer has to type a little bit more (if he doesn't have a smart 
  ide). But, the source code is more readable and understandable. There are no, 
  or at least much less doubts about what the programmer really wants to do. In 
  Obix, every input argument assignment must be written as:</p>
<p><code>input_argument_id = expression</code></p>
<p>Besides the better understandability, this syntax eliminates the risk of erroneously 
  permuting two arguments of the same type and adds compile-time error detection 
  when a command's input argument list is changed.</p>
<p>By the way, this syntax for a command's execution would be very appropriate 
  for a speech recognition system. Imagine how ordering a cup of coffee to a coffee 
  machine would be easy, by saying:</p>
<p><code>'service' 'coffee machine' 'command' 'make coffee' 'with milk' 'yes' 
  'with sugar' 'no'</code></p>
<p>The above code is just one example of the 'readability is more important than 
  writability' principle. Other examples can be found in the <a href="../manuals/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>
