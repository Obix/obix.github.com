<p class="pragmatic">First make it work, and then make it work fast!</p>
<p>Certainly, performance is important. Slow software frustrates users and thus 
  is a brake for success. But instead of digging into code tuning techniques, 
  let's just talk about the right <em>approach</em> for speed optimization.</p>
<p> Suppose we want to develop a compiler. A compiler is typically composed of 
  4 components: a scanner, parser, semantic analyzer and code generator/optimizer. 
  We start by developing the scanner which reads the source code and converts 
  it into tokens of different kinds, ignores any comments and detects syntax errors. 
  After finishing a first working version, we look at the code and see that we 
  could reduce the scanning time by an estimated 50%. Modifying the code will 
  take some time and will make the code a little bit more complex, but speed counts. 
  Should we change our code or shouldn't we? Clearly, the answer is: NO, not yet! 
  Why not? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>First, before the whole compiler isn't finished, we cannot be sure that we 
  will not do any changes to the scanner that will eliminate our speed improving 
  modifications.</p>
<p>Secondly, what really counts is the overall speed of the compiler. For example, 
  if the scanner takes only 5% of the total compilation time, then a 50% improvement 
  of the scanner would only result in a 2.5% total improvement.</p>
<p>Thirdly, code tuning generally hurts other qualities like readability and maintainability. 
  'Clever programming tricks' should only be used if really needed and, in that 
  case, be well documented in the source code.</p>
<p>Fourthly, estimating an improvement of speed is often deceptive. Until we haven't 
  written a test and <em>measured</em> the time, we cannot be sure of the real 
  gain and decide if it is worth changing the code.</p>
<p>Fifthly, execution speed often depends on environmental conditions. Performance 
  data measured on our machine can be completely different on other machines or 
  networks, because of different operating systems, compilers, virtual machines, 
  system configurations, and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, the general golden rule for code tuning is:</p>
<ol>
  <b> 
  <li>Write a <em>correct</em> and <em>well designed</em> program</li>
  <li><em>Measure</em> performance</li>
  <li>Optimize<em> if necessary</em></li>
  </b> 
</ol>
<p>Of course, exceptions to the above rule are time critical applications where 
  execution speed is imposed by the requirements. In these cases, we have to deal 
  with performance measurements and code optimizations from the beginning on.</p>
<p>Consequently, optimal performance through code tuning was not an issue during 
  early development of Obix. This concerns the source code for the compiler as 
  well as the target code produced by the compiler. Optimization will be a last 
  challenging task. </p>
