<h1>Support</h1>
<p class="pragmatic"> Appropriate support for users is indispensable!</p>
<p>Effective user support is an absolute requirement for a successful software 
  product. The best software is useless and surely becomes a flop if there is 
  no help for the user in trouble. The only exception would be perfect software, 
  the use of which would be intuitive and which would never fail. But as long 
  as this is only a dream we have to consider user support.</p>
<p> Two kinds of support can be distinguished:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Media helps available with the software. Examples are: 
    <ul>
      <li>clear and helpful error messages</li>
      <li>context sensitive help</li>
      <li>books: getting started, user's guide, reference manual, glossary, training 
        lessons and exercises, advanced knowledge, ...</li>
      <li>resources on Internet: online consulting and downloading of books, patches, 
        updates, news, technical articles, user groups, ...<br>
      </li>
      <li>training videos<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Human support by experienced people, like: 
    <ul>
      <li>consulting</li>
      <li>installation and configuration</li>
      <li>individual and group trainings, seminars</li>
      <li>hotlines</li>
      <li>maintenance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Human support is needed whenever the help must be fast and professional. Even 
  the best documentation cannot replace an experienced user who can deliver customized 
  and efficient teachings, quickly help in the case of subtle problems, and analyze 
  and discuss user-specific alternatives. But supporting people is not as fascinating 
  as programming and can even be boring. We cannot expect getting effective human 
  support for free. Such a service should be sold and be an option for every user.</p>
