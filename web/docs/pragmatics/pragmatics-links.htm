<p class="pragmatic">All further knowledge related to some knowledge should be 
  directly accessible!</p>
<p>Could you imagine the Internet without hyperlinks? Undoubtedly, hyperlinks 
  are one of the key reasons for the success of Internet. It is so easy to click 
  on an object and get additional information. Unfortunately, a lot of applications 
  don't provide hyperlinks and are therefore much less user-friendly. This should 
  be kept in mind when designing the user interface.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displaying a customer in an accounting application shows the total amount 
    of unpaid invoices. Clicking on this amount shows the list of unpaid invoices. 
    Clicking on one invoice of this list shows the invoice. Clicking on one line 
    item of the invoice shows the product's data. Et cetera, et cetera<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>An error displayed by a compiler should enable the programmer to have immediate 
    access to any related information in the technical documentation, as well 
    as to jump immediately into the source code containing the error.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Whenever appropriate, context sensitive help should be available in a consistent, 
    easy-to-use way.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A good example of extensive use of hyperlinks can be found at <a href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>, 
    one of the most popular and successful online shops. But be careful when visiting 
    the site: you risk buying more than you intended ;-).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although hyperlinks are widely used on Internet, they suffer from two inconveniences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hyperlinks are not always visible in an unambiguous way. Blue, underlined 
    text is not necessarily a hyperlink, and a hyperlink is not always blue, underlined 
    text. Moreover, there is no standard for distinguishing hyperlinked images 
    from images without hyperlinks. When the user wonders if a hyperlink is available, 
    he has to move the mouse over the image. A better way could be to display 
    a <em>standard</em> little button, e.g. a question mark, close to the hyperlinked 
    object.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Occasionally, more than one hyperlink exists for one object on screen. But 
    in HTML there is no direct support for multiple hyperlinks. The click of an 
    object's hyperlink could display a list of all available links in a standardized 
    way.</li>
</ul>
